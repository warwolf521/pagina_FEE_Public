This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

We will use bootstrap and bootstrap-react as css libraries.

The .env file is required to be in the root of the project in order to connect to Turso DB.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies for the server:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you want to run it in production mode, first build and compile the static templates with:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then run the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
